## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-start a new game
-place the boats on the gameboard and then start the game
-select squares on the computer gameboard to attack the enemy ships
-When computer or player has no ships left, the end screen will pop. He can restart the game and play again.

## My process

-   Created the factory functions and tested them to see if they work as intended.
-   After I created the factoryfunctions, I tested them inside a function and saw how the game would play.
-   Started creating the UI for the game.
-   During the UI creation made some small changes to the factory functions, like adding some extra methods that would improve the gameplay
-   I tested the game for multiple bad inputs from a player (like trying to place a ship out of bounds, or place them near each-other). This last condition took me some tries until I got it in the end.
-   Made the last changes on the UI (so it looks decent) and some last tests (to see if the game plays properly)

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

-   I learned again that even if I estimate that a task might take me x hours, I should add some extra time, just in case
-   First time I created a drag&drop event.
-   Saw the real use of writing tests first and what a difference it can make
-   Solving some new errors that js can point out to.
